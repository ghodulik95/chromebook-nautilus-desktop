# Customized Desktop Environment for Xubuntu on the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (Nautilus)

So you‚Äôve installed (or want to install) Linux on your beloved Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (Nautilus) but don‚Äôt want to deal with improper key mappings, poor tablet-mode handling, or missing ChromeOS conveniences (e.g., gesture navigation). Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthis repository should help! I have found these modifications sufficiently address those needs.

### Tested configuration

These modifications have been tested only on Xubuntu, specifically *Xubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)*. Your mileage may vary with other distros or Xubuntu versions, and many features may not work on non-Xfce desktops.

### Important disclaimers

__This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google or Samsung__.

__Use the scripts and configurations included in this project at your own risk.__

This project is **not** intended as a guide for updating Chromebook firmware or installing Linux once you have UEFI. However, [section 12](#uefi) contains some informal notes on my installation experience that may serve as an additional resource alongside proper documentation (I recommend MrChromebox). Proceed with caution, and do **not** assume those notes apply to any Chromebook other than the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (Nautilus). Replacing or modifying the original firmware for UEFI boot on a Chromebook can be riskier and more involved than a typical Linux installation on a PC. 

More disclaimers and limitations are noted in [disclaimers](#disclaimers) and [limitations](#limitations).

### Other Linux distributions?

[Section 10](#who-is-this-for) describes other distros I explored (NixOS, Manjaro, Fedora, Vanilla Puppy) before ultimately choosing Xubuntu. I highlight some hardware compatibility issues I encountered with each OS. In short, Xubuntu provided the best out-of-the-box experience among these options‚Äîeven though NixOS was my first preference. This is why I chose Xubuntu to ultimately further customize. The modifications in this project were not tested with those other distros I tried.

### Current experience

I have not run extensive stress tests on my Nautilus, but it‚Äôs currently running *wonderfully* for all my old Chromebook use cases and QOL preferences. Touch screen is great, even the stylus works great with Krita and Xournal++, including pressure sensitivity and palm rejection. And it is *significantly* speedier than ChromeOS had been running, even after a powerwash. [Performance notes](#performance-notes) contains some more details.

### Hardware limitations

Finally, please note that there are some serious hardware limitations related to the internal speakers, microphone, and the tablet-facing camera (the [normal webcam functions fine](#webcam-notes)). See the [limitations](#limitations) and [disclaimers](#disclaimers) for more details. **You have been warned.**

## 1. Limitations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

While Linux can run very well on the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 Nautilus, there are significant hardware limitations to note:

1. **Speakers do not work**  
2. **Microphone does not work**  
3. **Aux headphone jack does not work**  
4. **Tablet-facing camera does not work** (though the regular ‚Äúwebcam‚Äù camera does)

If you rely on internal audio or a built-in mic, this may be a dealbreaker.  

> **Bluetooth Audio Workaround**  
> - Headphone and microphone modes work great via Bluetooth.  
> - Anecdotally, Bluetooth under ChromeOS had become nearly unusable for me‚Äîfailing to connect to most devices. Under Xubuntu, Bluetooth has been rock-solid and easily connects to all my devices.

<details>
  <summary>Could the audio issues be fixable?</summary>

  [WeirdTreeThing‚Äôs audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio?tab=readme-ov-file) can fix audio on some Chromebooks. However, there‚Äôs a risk of permanently damaging the speakers at high volumes on this model. I tried it once on NixOS with no success and decided not to pursue further. If you need internal mic or headphone jack, feel free to explore that audio script solution‚Äîbut proceed with caution. Xubuntu is not officially supported by the audio script but Ubuntu 24.10 is, so that might be good enough ?

## 2. Features of This Project

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

This repository helps you keep some of the conveniences you had in ChromeOS:

1. **Functional F1‚ÄìF10 Row**  
   - Restores the top-row keys to Chromebook roles (Back, Forward, Refresh, Fullscreen, etc.).

2. **Tablet Mode**  
   - Disables the keyboard automatically when the screen is folded into tablet position, then re-enables it afterward.

3. **Swipe Navigation**  
   - Implements 3-finger swipes for browser back/forward/refresh (mimicking ChromeOS-style gestures), including cute hacky custom animations (that are easy to disable). 
   - Confirmed to work with Google Chrome, Firefox, Tor Browser, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and Falkon (minor configuration to `touchegg.conf` needed to add support for gesture nav on other browsers). (*Aside note: I installed these browsers to confirm gesture support. While they seemed to run well, my use of them was very minimal so I'm not sure how well they run overall.*)
   - 2-finger gestures not supported.

4. **Bluetooth Headphone/Headset Toggle**  
   - Quickly switch between high-quality audio (‚Äúheadphone‚Äù) and mic-enabled (‚Äúheadset‚Äù) modes.

5. **Tap-to-Click & Natural Scrolling**  
   - Makes the touchpad behave more like ChromeOS.

## 3. What‚Äôs Not Included

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

- **Firmware Installation Steps**  
  I do not provide detailed instructions for flashing or replacing the Chromebook‚Äôs firmware. For that, refer to [MrChromebox‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/).

- **Full Xubuntu Installation Tutorial**  
  Once UEFI boot is enabled, installing Xubuntu is similar to any standard PC. I won‚Äôt provide every step here.

- **System-Wide or Power-User Customizations**  
  These configs focus on replicating a ChromeOS-like, single-user experience. If you want multi-user or heavily locked-down setups, you can adapt these scripts as needed.

## 4. Disclaimers

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

__This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google or Samsung__.

### 4.1. Warranties & Risk of Bricking
Modifying the Chromebook firmware and installing Linux on this device can void your warranty and carries an inherent risk of bricking. Use of this project assumes you have already done this, but I'm just putting this here anyway.

### 4.2. Known hardware limitations and risks
I'll repeat here: internal speakers, headphone jack, microphone, and tablet-facing camera do not work. Workarounds on the speakers are specifically known to potentially cause permanent damage. See [Limitations](#limitations).

### 4.3. My attempts at addressing the hardware limitations
While I put in *some* effort to get the speakers, headphone jack, and microphone to work, I put in zero effort at getting the tablet camera to work. You might have more luck than me, finding an easy workaround. I suspect that many of these limitations will be a very involved process to work around, however, so I would not recommend proceeding if any of that hardware is essential to you and you don't have the capacity to spend several hours sorting it out (and possibly come up empty). If that sounds like a fun challenge for you, though, then awesome. Please let me know how it goes.

## 5. Quick Start

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

Here‚Äôs a high-level outline of the key setup steps. For more specific instructions and commands, see the [Installation](#installation) section.

1. **Clone or Download This Project**  
   - Either `git clone https://github.com/ghodulik95/chromebook-nautilus-desktop.git` or download the ZIP to your new Xubuntu install.

2. **Install Required Packages**  
    The package projects include brightnessctl, grep, xbindkeys, xdotool, libinput-tools, touchegg (requires adding official repository link), imagemagick, yad, x11-utils, google-chrome-stable (requires adding official repository link). You can install with this command to make sure you use the same versions as I did (using system defaults will probably work just fine though).
    
		cd path/to/project
		sed '/^\s*#/d;/^\s*$/d' packages.txt | xargs sudo apt install -y
    

3. **Modify Google Chrome .desktop launcher file**
	
	Many of the top-row keymappings require the following launch flag to prevent key interception by Chrome:

        --disable-features=KeyboardShortcutViewer

4. **Copy Project Files to Your Home Directory**  

		rsync -av --exclude 'README.md' --exclude 'packages.txt' path-to-project/ ~/


5. **Make Scripts Executable**  

    	chmod +x ~/bin/tablet-mode-handler.sh
    	chmod +x ~/bin/toggle-headset-mode.sh
   		chmod +x ~/bin/detect-webcam.sh
   		chmod +x ~/bin/gesture-flash.sh


6. **Enable Passwordless Sudo**  
   - Add entries in `sudo visudo` to allow the tablet-mode script and brightnessctl package to run without password prompts.

6. **Reboot & Validate**  
   - Flip the screen to test tablet-mode.  
   - Confirm the top-row keys work as expected.  
   - Test gestures, brightness, and Bluetooth audio if you configured them.  

For more in-depth instructions, see the next section.

## 6. Installation & Setup Steps

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

These steps assume you‚Äôve already replaced the Chromebook‚Äôs firmware with something UEFI-capable (e.g., via MrChromebox scripts).

### 6.1. Install Xubuntu

1. **Flash Xubuntu to a USB-C stick** 
	- I used Rufus on Windows.
	- I flashed *Xubuntu 24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)*.
2. **Boot via UEFI**  
3. **Install Xubuntu** as you would on any PC.

### 6.2. (Optional, but Recommended) Enable Tap-to-Click & Natural Scrolling

If you regularly used tap-to-click, natural scrolling, and two-finger-tap-for-right-click when running ChromeOS, these modifications are essential. By default, Xubuntu‚Äôs GUI may not expose these settings (It didn't for me). To enable them:

    sudo mkdir -p /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
    sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-touchpad.conf

Paste:

    Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "Touchpad defaults"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
    EndSection

Save and reboot/logout and back in. *I have not looked into mousepad momentum scrolling so I cannot say how easy or difficult that is to enable or implement. I might look into it in the future. I have found the default mousepad scrolling sensitivity great. Touchscreen momentum scrolling DOES work (at least on Chrome).*

### 6.3. Add necessary repositories

#### (Required) Add Touch√©gg repository
**Xubuntu** includes an old version of Touch√©gg by default. For full functionality, you must add the updated [repository as per documentation](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg#ubuntu-debian-and-derivatives). At time of this writing, that documentation is:

	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:touchegg/stable
	sudo apt update

#### Google Chrome ppa repository
You can skip if you do not want to use Google Chrome.

    wget -q -O - https://dl.google.com/linux/linux_signing_key.pub | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/google-chrome.gpg

    echo 'deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/google-chrome.gpg] https://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list

    sudo apt update

You could also download via browser from Google's official website and install that way (just note this when installing packages, and skip over the google-chrome-stable package).

### 6.4. Download/Clone This Project

Download the .zip, or clone the git repository:

1. Install Git if needed:
    
        sudo apt install git

2. Clone the repo (or download a `.zip` and use `unzip` to unzip):
    
        git clone https://github.com/ghodulik95/chromebook-nautilus-desktop.git

### 6.5. Install Required Packages

In the project root directory:

    sed '/^\s*#/d;/^\s*$/d' packages.txt | xargs sudo apt install -y

**Installs:**
- `brightnessctl=0.5.1-3.1`  
  + For brightness controls
- `grep=3.11-4build1`  
  + Used in some scripts
- `xbindkeys=1.8.7-2`  
  + For keymapping Xmodmap does not handle well
- `xdotool=1:3.20160805.1-5build1`  
  + For certain keymapping commands
- `libinput-tools`
  + For detecting tablet-mode event emitting hardware
- `imagemagick`, `yad`, `x11-utils`
  + For color/image processing and window animation in swipe gesture browser animations in ~/bin/gesture-flash.sh
- `google-chrome-stable` (from official Google repository, added in prior steps)  
- Touch√© (the `touchegg` package from PPA or Ubuntu repo)  
  + For multi-touch gesture commands

*Note: Specifying exact package versions is probably unnecessary. However, the internet tells me that some versions of xbindkeys do not add an autostart rule by default, so if the default package does not do this you may need to manually add an autostart rule that runs xbindkeys.*

#### Alternative: Single-line install command

With version specifications:
    
    sudo apt install -y brightnessctl=0.5.1-3.1 grep=3.11-4build1 xbindkeys=1.8.7-2 xdotool=1:3.20160805.1-5build1 libinput-tools imagemagick yad x11-utils google-chrome-stable touchegg

Without version specifications:
    
    sudo apt install -y brightnessctl grep xbindkeys xdotool libinput-tools imagemagick yad x11-utils google-chrome-stable imagemagic touchegg

#### If using the detect-webcam script
you will also need to install v4l-utils. This can be done with the below command or by uncommenting the package in packages.txt before installing via packages.txt.

		sudo apt install -y v4l-utils

### 6.6. Modifying the Google Chrome Launcher

To prevent Chrome from intercepting the Chromebook top-row keys (e.g., Back, Refresh, Fullscreen), you‚Äôll need to modify its `.desktop` launcher. (When I tested, Vivaldi and Brave worked without customization, but it is possible some Chromium and Chromium-based browsers could need this too.)

1. **Copy the system launcher to your local applications directory**:

        mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications/
        cp /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/

2. **Edit the copied file**:

        nano ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop

3. **Add the following flag** to each `Exec=` line:

        --disable-features=KeyboardShortcutViewer

    For example, change:

        Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U

    to:

        Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --disable-features=KeyboardShortcutViewer %U

#### Example Diff

        --- /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop
        +++ ~/.local/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop
        @@ -2,7 +2,7 @@
         Version=1.0
         Name=Google Chrome
         GenericName=Web Browser
        -Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U
        +Exec=/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable --disable-features=KeyboardShortcutViewer %U
         Terminal=false
         Icon=google-chrome
         Type=Application

*Note that there are several Exec= lines for different launching options, and it is recommended to add the flag to each so that your top-row keys work as expected at all times.*

**Important**: If you launch Chrome without this parameter, many of the top-row key mappings will break, because Chrome intercepts those keys and will not interpret them appropriately. It's possible that Chromium and other Chromium-based browsers would need this flag. However, Vivaldi and Brave (both Chromium-based to my knowledge) seemed to work fine.

### 6.7. Copy Project Files to Your Home Directory

    rsync -av --exclude 'README.md' --exclude 'packages.txt' path-to-project/ ~/

**What‚Äôs Being Copied?**  
- **Configuration files** for keyboard mapping, gesture handling, and autostart scripts  
- **Desktop files** for autostart (like tablet mode handling, XModMap, etc.)  
- **Custom shell scripts** (for toggling headset mode, linking webcam device, etc.)

You can see a deeper breakdown in [Section 7](#project-file-overview). The autostart `.desktop` files go into `~/.config/autostart/`. If you decide you don‚Äôt want one of these services running at login, open **Session and Startup** (in the Xubuntu Settings GUI) and uncheck or remove the relevant entry.

### 6.8. Make scripts Executable

    chmod +x ~/bin/tablet-mode-handler.sh
    chmod +x ~/bin/toggle-headset-mode.sh
    chmod +x ~/bin/detect-webcam.sh
    chmod +x ~/bin/gesture-flash.sh

*For a tabular breakdown of what these scripts do, see [this table in section 7](#tabular)*

### 6.9. Enable Passwordless Sudo

You need passwordless sudo for:

- `tablet-mode-handler.sh` (managing tablet mode)  
  + The tablet event id can change across boots, so sudo is needed to read the device list from libinput every boot/login.
- `brightnessctl` (adjusting screen brightness)  
  + This software appears to require sudo privileges for basic use.

Use:

    sudo visudo

Then add lines like (replacing your-username 3 times with your username):

    your-username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /home/your-username/bin/tablet-mode-handler.sh
    your-username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/brightnessctl

### 6.10. (Optional, but Recommended if you'll be making video calls) Add Keyboard Shortcut for Bluetooth Headset Toggle

    xfconf-query \
      -c xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts \
      -p "/commands/custom/<Primary><Alt>h" \
      -n -t string -s "bin/toggle-headset-mode.sh"

Or do this in **Keyboard > Application Shortcuts**. Feel free to modify the keymapping in the command or in the GUI if you do not want to use Ctrl+Alt+H.

> **Note**: Some applications may automatically toggle your headphones into headset mode (mic enabled) without any manual intervention. However, if you plan to use headphones in video calls and don‚Äôt see an auto-toggle, this script plus a shortcut can be handy. Because the webcam device id can change across boots, applications might not operate consistently (more on that in [webcam notes](#webcam-notes)).

### 6.11. Log out and back in, or reboot.

Confirm everything is working:

1. Flip into tablet mode. You should get a notification and you can confirm the keyboard is disabled and re-enabled when you exit tablet mode.
2. Open Chrome (or your preferred browser) normally, and you can test the 3-finger swiping for back and forward, and the top row keys for back, forward, refresh, and fullscreen. You should see little arrow navigations for back/forward/refresh in browsers. (If you are using a browser I did not add support for, adding support is very easy by following instructions in the comments of `~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf`. You can also easily disable the animations here.)
3. Test brightness and volume keys. (The volume keys should still be responsive even without connected to Bluetooth. This should still be responsive without having a Bluetooth device connected.)
4. Confirm the "lock" key actually is "Delete". 
	- (This is not standard ChromeOS functionality, but I made an assumption that most Linux users would prefer to have a Delete key, which is otherwise not present on the keyboard. If you prefer a lock/sleep behavior, there is guidance on how to do that in the comments of `.config/keyboardmapping/.Xmodmap`)
5. Test bluetooth headset audio toggle (Ctrl+Alt+h if using default keymapping).
6. If using the detect-webcam script, you can test with `guvcview -d /dev/webcam` (requires installing guvcview). If the camera opens with no additional prompting, the symlink worked.
	+ Note that `cheese` and `ffplay` did not seem to cooperate with specifying devices at command line, so if you test with these, it may appear the symlink did not work. This is why I recommend testing with `guvcview`.
7. Test that the window manage key captures a screenshot to clipboard. There should be a quick notification.
	- If you don't want a notification (e.g. you do a lot of back to back screenshots and don't want the notication in view), I have included commented out keymappings in `.xkeybindsrc` that will forego the notification.
8. Confirm tap-to-click, 2-finger tap right-click, and 2-finger natural scrolling works.
9. All set. Hoorah!

### 6.12. Other desktop configurations to consider.

1. Window snapping on screen edge *should* already be enabled, although I found it pretty difficult to activate without tap-to-click enabled via step 6.2. If for some reason it is not enabled, the setting is in Window Manager Tweaks > Accessibility. I think this requires display compositing, which should also be enabled, but if it is not, the setting is in Window Manager Tweaks > Compositor.
	- You might want to enable Window snapping to other windows in Window Manager > Advanced.
2. In Window Manager Tweaks > Compository, you can modify opacity of windows when they are moving or inactive.
3. Since I didn't have a use case for the Window manager key (right of the fullscreen key), I mapped this to do a fullscreen screenshot to clipboard. If you'd prefer a different mapping, modify `~/.xbindkeysrc`.
4. Touch√©gg has a lot more potential use for more complex swipe navigation. I only include rules for 3-finger swiping for back/forward/refresh/maximize/minimize and 2-finger pinch-to-zoom (note that maximize, minimize and pinch-to-zoom were provided by the default config). Modications can be made to `~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf`.
5. Pretty much any other Xubuntu/Xfce configurations you want.

## 7. Project File Overview

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

All the copied files in `~/` after installation serve different roles, but they can be grouped as follows:

### 7.1 Autostart, Input, and Custom Scripts

1. **Autostart Desktop Files** (`~/.config/autostart/`)  
   - **`Tablet Mode Toggle.desktop`**  
     - Runs `bin/tablet-mode-handler.sh` at login, starting a process that listens for input events so it can automatically enable/disable your keyboard when you fold the screen.  
     - This file was originally generated by Xubuntu‚Äôs autostart manager.
   - **`XModMap.desktop`**  
     - Applies `.config/keyboardmapping/.Xmodmap` to restore top-row keys (Back, Forward, Mute, Volume, etc.).  
     - Note that some of the top-row mappings are handled by xbindkeys instead.
     - This file was originally generated by Xubuntu‚Äôs autostart manager.
   - **`touchegg.desktop`**  
     - Starts the Touch√© daemon (the `touchegg` package) to enable multi-finger gestures.  
     - This file was originally generated by Xubuntu‚Äôs autostart manager.
   - **`webcam-link.desktop`**  
     - (Disabled by default, as most users probably won't need this) Runs `detect-webcam.sh` on login, creating a stable `/dev/webcam` symlink.
     - This file was originally generated by Xubuntu‚Äôs autostart manager.

* *(Also, note xbindkeys should add its own autostart under `/etc/xdg/autostart/xbindkeys.desktop` or `/usr/share/xsessions/xbindkeys.desktop`; if not, you‚Äôd need to manually add an autostart rule at the user or system level.)*

2. **Input Config & Gesture Mapping**  
   - **`.config/keyboardmapping/.Xmodmap`**  
     - Remaps many F-row keys to their Chromebook counterparts.  
     - Lock button is mapped to delete instead. (Alternative Lock/Sleep mappings included in comments.)
     - This file contains many of the default contents from running xmodmap -pke (which prints the current keymap to stdout).
   - **`.xbindkeysrc`**  
     - Handles keys that `xmodmap` can‚Äôt, like brightness.  
     - The window manage key is set to screenshot to clipboard.
     - This file contains many of the default contents from running xbindkeys --defaults (which outputs a sample/default configuration).
   - **`.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf`**  
     - Defines gesture mappings (e.g., 3-finger swipes for browser back/forward, refresh, maximize, minimize, pinch-to-zoom).
     - This file contains many of the default contents created after first launching touchegg or running touchegg --generate-config.

3. **Custom Scripts** (`~/bin/`)  
   - **`tablet-mode-handler.sh`**  
     - Detects and toggles keyboard off/on in tablet mode.  
   - **`toggle-headset-mode.sh`**  
     - Switches a Bluetooth device between headphone (A2DP) and headset (HSP/HFP) with mic enabled.  
   - **`gesture-flash.sh`**
   	 - Creates quick fading back/forward/refresh animations 
   - **`detect-webcam.sh`**  
     - Creates a symlink `/dev/webcam` to your actual camera device (which can vary from boot to boot). Used by the (disabled by default) `webcam-link.desktop`.

## 8. Troubleshooting

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

Below are some issues you could run into.

### 8.1 Brightness Keys Not Working

- **Check if `xbindkeys` is running**  

		pgrep -laf xbindkeys  
  
  If there‚Äôs no output, try `xbindkeys` manually or create a `.desktop` file in `~/.config/autostart/` or via GUI to start it.

- **Test Manual Brightness**  

    	brightnessctl s 50  
    	
  If you can set brightness manually, your bindings or permissions may be misconfigured. (Probably requires sudo)

### 8.2 Tablet Mode Doesn‚Äôt Disable the Keyboard

- **Ensure `tablet-mode-handler.sh` is executable**  
    
    	chmod +x ~/bin/tablet-mode-handler.sh

- **Check Sudoers**  
  The script uses `libinput list-devices` which requires sudo. Confirm this script has passwordless sudo with `sudo visudo`
  
- **Ensure autostart rule is enabled**

### 8.3 No Speaker, aux audio (headphone jack), or tablet-facing camera

- **[Known Device Limitation](#limitations)**  
  The internal speakers, microphone, and headphone jack don‚Äôt work out-of-the-box on the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (or potentially at all). Use Bluetooth. Attempt advanced fixes at your own risk.

### 8.4 Multi-Finger Gestures Not Working

- **Confirm Touch√© Daemon is running**  
There should be a system service daemon running:

		systemctl status touchegg
A debug process can be started with

	touchegg --debug  
		
Check stdout to see if gestures are detected. If not, verify that `~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf` is loaded and autostart rule is present and enabled.

- It's been my experience that installing new UI packages can break Touch√© processes or cause them to glitch temporarily. A reboot should fix this.
- Refer to Touch√© [documentation](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg) for more guidance. 
  
### 8.5 Webcam Issues

- **Check Video Devices**  

    	v4l2-ctl --list-devices
    	
	The webcam should be something like
	
		720p HD Camera: 720p HD Camera (usb-0000:00:14.0-9):
			/dev/video0
			/dev/video1
			/dev/media0
	
	The first /dev/video* entry should be the correct one. These can vary across boots.

- **Test with GUVCView or Cheese**  
   	Replacing /dev/video0 with the path from above:
    	
    	guvcview -d /dev/video*
    
  or open `cheese` or `ffplay` and manually select the 720p HD Camera, which should be the webcam. Specifying a device id in terminal with `cheese` and `ffplay` does not work in my experience. (There may be multiple entries with this device naming. Be sure to check each of them. Only one is expected to work.)

- **Symlink**  
  If you are using an application that requires a consistent device id, enable `webcam-link.desktop` to consistently link the device id to `/dev/webcam` on startup.

### 8.6 Key Mappings Revert After Reboot

- **Ensure XModMap autostart**  
  Verify `XModMap.desktop` is enabled in **Session and Startup**.
-- **Ensure xbindkeys autostart**  
  Verify that an autostart entry for **xbindkeys** is enabled in **Session and Startup**.  
  On my system, `xbindkeys` created this automatically during installation. If that didn‚Äôt happen for you, you‚Äôll need to manually add one that calls `xbindkeys_autostart` (which should handle stuff config updates and other process handling stuff, making it less likely to need to restart if there's some crash). 
  
### 8.7 Back button key, Forward button key, Refresh key, other top-level keys not working on Chrome
Google Chrome may intercept top-level keys. Be sure you are running with the proper flags. See [Installation instructions](#installation) for how to make sure to launch Chrome with these flags by default. Possibly updating Chrome could require you to redo this step.

### 8.8 XYZ is having package issues
Make sure necessary packages are installed. Consider running `sudo apt update` and/or `sudo apt upgrade`

The functionalities have package dependenceis as follows:
| Functionality                     | Package Dependencies                                           |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Keymappings                      | xbindkeys, xdotool, xmodmap, brightnessctl, xfce4-screenshooter |
| Table mode                       | libinput-tools                                                 |
| Gesture navigation with animations | touchegg, yad, x11-utils, imagemagick, xdotool                |
| Detect and symlink camera        | v4l-utils                                                      |

For all but touchegg, you should be able to just use the default Xubuntu packages and install with `sudo apt install`.

### 8.9 Gesture navigation issues
- Make sure you have added the touchegg repository and installed properly. The default package provided by Xubuntu will not have work with all features of this project. See [installation](#installation) for more guidance.
- Make sure ~/.config/touchegg/touchegg.conf is present and contains the gestures
- Make sure touchegg dependencies are installed and up to date
- Confirm the touchegg daemon is running with `systemctl status touchegg`
- Run `touchegg --verbose` to confirm that a touchegg process is able to attach to the daemon, and see if gestures are detected.

### 8.10 Notable Debugging Tools/Commands

- **showkey**, **xev**, **xbindkeys -v**  
  - For debugging keycodes and verifying your mappings.
- **libinput debug-events**  
  - For seeing tablet-mode events and other hardware input.
- **Touch√©** (`touchegg --debug`)  
  - For confirming multi-touch gesture detection.

## 9. Webcam Notes

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

- **Works Out of the Box**: The front-facing webcam (labeled something like *720p HD Camera*) typically works fine without the `detect-webcam.sh` script. However, you might see *several* `/dev/videoX` devices in some apps, and only one of them is the real camera feed.

- **Symlink Behavior**:  
  If you do enable `detect-webcam.sh`, you can then run:
  
      guvcview -d /dev/webcam
  
  to confirm it opens your live camera feed.  
  - **Cheese & ffplay** didn't accept an explicit `/dev/webcam` argument for me, but they still detected the camera automatically so that it could be manually selected from a list.

- **Tablet-Facing Camera**:  
  Currently not detected at all in Linux. I haven‚Äôt explored possible fixes, so I can‚Äôt speculate on how to get it running.

## 10. Who This Project Is For & Distro Observations

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

- **Primary Focus**: A single-user laptop experience that mimics Chromebook shortcuts.  
- **Not (necessarily) a Power-Linux Layout**: You can adapt these configs for more complex setups if you wish, but out-of-the-box, it‚Äôs intended for a straightforward, ChromeOS-like environment.

### Distros I Tried

- **Xubuntu**  
- **NixOS**  
- **Manjaro**  
- **Fedora**  
- **Vanilla Puppy**

I can't remember specifically what worked and didn't, but most distros besides Xubuntu had something that wasn't easily working out-of-the-box. Wifi, Bluetooth, and tap-to-click are all issues I remember running into. I most earnestly tried NixOS as I really wanted to use it. I even tried the audio fix script from chrultrabook, but that didn't work, and Bluetooth was spotty across different configuration.nix builds.

## 11. Performance Notes

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

- **Overall Performance**: Excellent. The Intel Core m3 processor handles everyday tasks smoothly under Xubuntu (web, media, notetaking app with stylus, etc.).
	+ The only times I noticed (mildly) concerning lag was when I was running a heavy apt install with multiple other things open.

- **Battery Life**:  
  - I don‚Äôt have precise or everyday-use measurements yet because I‚Äôve been doing consistently doing heavy installs and testing.  
  - It might drain a bit faster than ChromeOS did, but still significantly better than my i7 ultrabook in comparable usage.  
  - Under typical (light) usage, you could still see very good battery life‚Äîjust not necessarily identical to how it was ChromeOS at my machine's prime.

- **Miscellaneous**:  
  - Krita and Xournal++ seem to work great though for stylus drawing and note taking, including pressure-sensitivity and palm-rejection working out of the box. Much more smooth than the Android apps I was using most recently.
  - I tried OpenBoard, but had trouble getting dependencies to work.
  - GIMP runs smoothly but stylus stuff like pressure sensitivity did not work out of the box, and I haven't made a strong effort to get it to work. In settings, the stylus did not seem to be detected in Input Devices, so potentially more configuration is needed.
  - I successfully was able to install browsers Google Chrome, Firefox, Tor Browser, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and Falkon, but did not use them beyond confirming that keymappings and gestures worked.
  - Ghostwrite has been working great for writing this README.
  - Basic dev tools needed for interacting with github (i.e. gh for authorization, mousepad for text editing, meld for diff viewing) have worked great. I have not attempted heavier development.

## 12. UEFI Firmware Installation (Non-Comprehensive Summary)

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#top)  
[üîó Back to TOC](#toc)

*This is **not** a full guide. Before proceeding with any firmware changes, thoroughly read [MrChromebox‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/getting-started.html). The steps below are only additional notes specific to the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (Nautilus), and are not meant as a full guide by any means.*

1. **Tools Needed**  
   - A small screwdriver  
   - A thin-edged tool (e.g., a small plastic pry tool or a blunt knife) to help gently pop off the back cover  
   - A USB-C flash drive  
   - A USB-C charger that can power the device *without* its battery connected (**Note**: higher-watt chargers are unlikely to work; your safest option is the official Google charger. You could test this out before making irreversible software changes, but doing so could still void warranties potentially.)

2. **Checking Device Compatibility**  
   - Verify that your Chromebook is the Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (codename ‚ÄúNautilus‚Äù).  
   - If unsure, open `chrome://version` in Chrome to confirm.  
   - At time of this writing, Nautilus is supported by the MrChromebox tools. You can double check [here](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/supported-devices.html)

3. **Developer Mode**  
   - Enabling Developer Mode **will** wipe the device. Be sure to backup important files.  
   - After doing so, you‚Äôll boot into a Developer Mode environment (not the standard ChromeOS desktop).

4. **Disabling Hardware Write Protection**  
   - You disable write protection at the hardware level by removing the bottom cover and disconnecting the battery.  
   - With the battery unplugged, you must power the device via a suitable USB-C charger.  
   - The first minute of [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKZEH0U9Mto) may be helpful.

5. **Installing the Firmware**  
   - Have USB-C flash drive handy for creating a backup of your existing firmware (strongly recommended, will likely make fixes easier if things go wrong). The firmware tool walks you through this.  
   - Run the MrChromebox firmware utility script. It will require a reboot to disable firmware write protection, then proceed with installing the UEFI ROM.
   - Overall the MrChromebox software hand-holds you through the process very well in my opinion.

6. **Alternative: RW_LEGACY + dual-boot**  
   - If you prefer dual-booting ChromeOS and Linux, you can install RW_LEGACY firmware instead (MrChromebox also provides tools for this), which does not appear require disabling hardware write protection (I think).  
   - This project assumes on full UEFI firmware replacement, but it might work with dual-booting Xubuntu as well.  
   - I did not attempt this at all, so I have no first-hand experience.

**Important:** If you read this far into this section but have *not* gone through MrChromebox‚Äôs documentation in detail, you are *not* prepared to do this responsibly. These steps only provide brief additional notes for Nautilus devices (and Nautilus devices only); the official MrChromebox documentation remains your primary reference.
