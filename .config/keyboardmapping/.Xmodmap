! Chromebook Nautilus Desktop Top Row Remapping
! Below are specific mappings for the Chromebook Nautilus from:
! https://github.com/ghodulik95/chromebook-nautilus-desktop
! This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Google or Samsung.
!
! The following mappings are for the top-row keys on the
! Samsung Chromebook Plus v2 (Nautilus), which are not actually labeled
! as F# keys on the keyboard.
!
! Note that top-row keys omitted here are instead mapped with xbindkeys,
! as their functionality was more complex, and/or there was some funkiness with
! Nautilus mappings that made xbindkeys a better fit for some cases
! and xmodmap a better fit for other. (Though I might be misremembering.)
!
! While I generally recommend using tools like `xev | grep keycode` and `xbindkeys -k`
! to identify keycodes and modifiers, I vaguely recall that `showkey` was useful
! in a few edge cases â€” though I may be mistaken about that as well.
!
! As noted in documentation, Google Chrome (and likely Chromium) may intercept
! these key events unless launched with the flag:
!     --disable-features=KeyboardShortcutViewer
