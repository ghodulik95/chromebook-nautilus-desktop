		Animations dont really seem to work, at least with Xfce *shrug*.
		So gestures are set not to be animated.
		The <command> tags in gestures appear to be broken, so for now we
		are restricted to the basic key commands. But you can do a lot with that!
		Much/most of this file is the touché default conf, at least until gestures
		are specified.

    <!-- 
      Delay, in milliseconds, since the gesture starts before the animation is displayed.
      Default: 150ms if this property is not set.
      Example: Use the MAXIMIZE_RESTORE_WINDOW action. You will notice that no animation is
      displayed if you complete the action quick enough. This property configures that time.
    -->
    <property name="animation_delay">150</property>

    <!--
      Percentage of the gesture to be completed to apply the action. Set to 0 to execute actions unconditionally.
      Default: 20% if this property is not set.
      Example: Use the MAXIMIZE_RESTORE_WINDOW action. You will notice that, even if the
      animation is displayed, the action is not executed if you did not move your fingers far
      enough. This property configures the percentage of the gesture that must be reached to
      execute the action.

      Global animation colors can be configured to match your system colors using HEX notation:

        <color>909090</color>
        <borderColor>FFFFFF</borderColor>

      You can also use auto:

        <property name="color">auto</property>
        <property name="borderColor">auto</property>

      Notice that you can override an specific animation color.
